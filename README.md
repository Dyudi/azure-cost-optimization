# Managing Billing Records in Azure Serverless Architecture
Implementation Steps
- Step 1 :- Identify and Migrate Cold Data
- Step 2 :- Blob Storage Configuration
- Step 3 :- Transparent Access Logic
- Step 4 :- Zero Downtime Deployment
- Azure Function to Migrate Old Records
- This function can run on a timer trigger. The records older than 3 months in the Cosmos DB can store to Blob storage. Then optionally deletes them from Cosmos DB (or marks as archived).
- Read Fallback Function
-  This function can be dropped into your existing API logic without any contract change.
-   Zero Downtime Rollout
--   Deploy the fallback read path first.
--   Run the migration on a small subset to test.
--  Confirm old records load correctly.
--   Scale migration to all older records.
--   Monitor Cosmos DB size and RU consumptionâ€”costs will drop.
